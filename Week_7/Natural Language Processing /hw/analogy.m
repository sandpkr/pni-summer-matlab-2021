function word4 = analogy(vectors, words, word1, word2, word3)
% Look up the completion of the analogy:
%     word1 is to word2 as word3 is to word4
% Test with the following:
%   analogy(vectors, words, 'man', 'king', 'woman')

% Get the embedding of each the input word




% Compute the embedding of word4


% Find the closest word to the new embedding
